### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, is one of my favorites because I had to do most of it myself.
    My partner was unavailable for a majority of the lab. Because of that
    it was both challenging and interesting as I had to learn about how
    blackjack and the high-low game worked with more than two inputs,
    especially with more than 2 aces in blackjack.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, is one of my favorites since I worked on part-2 of the lab.
    Before this lab came out I had been thinking about how a prime number
    may be determined. It was great to know how to determine a prime number
    given any number quickly by running a simple program.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10, is one of my favorites since I got to work on 2D vectors.
    2D vectors were something I was always excited for since I have personal
    experience with them and I really enjoy working with them. Seeing how
    2D vectors were written and iterated through in C++ compared to Java
    was very interesting to me.
